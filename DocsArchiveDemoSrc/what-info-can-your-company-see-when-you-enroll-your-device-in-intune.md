# What information can my company see when I enroll my device?

When you enroll a device into management, you are giving your company permission to view certain pieces of information on your device to help protect the corporate data on the device.

**What your company can never see**

- Calling and web browsing history
- Email and text messages
- Contacts
- Calendar
-	Passwords
- Pictures, including what's in the photos app or camera roll

**What your company can always see**

- Device model, like iPhone 7
- Manufacturer, like Microsoft
- Operating system, like Android 7.1
- App names, like Microsoft Word
- Device owner
- Device name
- Serial number

**What your company might be able to see**

-  Phone number: for **Corporate**-owned devices, your full phone number can be seen. For **Personal**-owned devices, just the last four digits of your phone number are visible to your company. You can see the **Ownership Type** for each individual device  by opening that device's **Device Details** page. 
-  Location: your company can never see your device's location, except if you have an iOS device that is supervised and has gotten lost. [How do I know?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=853816)
